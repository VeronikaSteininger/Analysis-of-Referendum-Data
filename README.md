# Analysis-of-Referendum-Data
This project is about to perform and test different methods (spacial visualization, statistic analysis, time series analysis) at two different datasets namely the official results of the 2021 Referendum "Deutsche Wohnen und Co enteignen" in Berlin and the NY houseowner rate from 1984 to 2018.
There are similarities concerning the context: Both datasets deal with the housing issue in capital cities and could be an important basis for further analysis and political decisions.

In this context however, the datasets are treated as test sets to learn different methods and to understand their potentials and limits.
